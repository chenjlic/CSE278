The file Q1_A.cpp is code that computes the perimeter and the area of a         rectangle when given a width and the height via user input.

The file Q1_B.cpp is code that computes the perimeter and the area of a circle  when given the radius via user input.

The file Q2_A.cpp is code that takes in an account string and password string   to allow the user to "login."

The file Q2_B.cpp does the same as Q2_A.cpp but is non case sensitive.

The file Q3.cpp creates an array of integers with values specified by user input
